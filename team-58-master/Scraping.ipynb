I know a few others who also share the same view.\"The CAA, which facilitates granting of Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, was passed by Parliament in 2019 and had led to protests in different parts of the country.The President had given his assent to the legislation on December 12, 2019.The objective of the CAA is to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities -- Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian -- from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.People from these communities who had come to India till December 31, 2014 due to religious persecution in these countries will not be treated as illegal immigrants but be given Indian citizenship.After the CAA was passed by Parliament, widespread protests were witnessed in the country. Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution.They also allege that the CAA along with the National Register of Citizens is intended to target the Muslim community in India.\\xa0Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Khalistani supporters were there, they are there. All know it, whether it is the intelligence agencies at the Centre, the police in Punjab or those whose government is there,\" she said.\"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Ji not sending out a single tweet appealing for peace somewhere shows the fear that if you comment on the violence in Patiala, it will anger your Khalistani supporters,\" she alleged.\"I think both the governments (at Centre and state) are playing with fire because Punjab is a border state. They cannot run away from their accountability, neither will Congress allow them to do so,\" Ms Lamba said.Two groups had clashed in Patiala on Friday over an anti-Khalistan march, hurling stones at each other and brandishing swords, forcing the police to fire in the air to bring the situation under control.With the arrest of six more people, the number of accused who had been arrested so far reached nine, police said.Ms Lamba also accused the AAP of peddling \"soft Hindutva\".Referring to the AAP\\'s plan to float \\'tiranga shakhas\\' in Uttar Pradesh on the lines of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Ms Lamba said AAP leaders are coming up with all these programmes on RSS lines and \"sadly\" involving the national flag in their \"pretence\".\"Their (RSS and AAP\\'s) thinking, their methods are the same. One is walking on the line of radical Hindutva, the other wants to follow soft Hindutva. But this is a secular country,\" she said.\"This country will run by the independence given in the Constitution and not by the modalities of the Sangh and the BJP\\'s A, B, C, D teams,\" Ms Lamba said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Signing up rival parties has been a strict no-no from the special committee deliberating on Mr Kishor\\'s entry, and while the election strategist has formally dissociated from IPAC, he is widely known to be privy to the decisions of the organisation that he led for nearly a decade.Party sources told NDTV that the Committee is divided on Mr Kishor\\'s entry, which some see as necessary in view of the party\\'s inexorable downward spiral. While those in favour include Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Ambika Soni, the naysayers are Digvijaya Singh, Mukul Wasnik, Randeep Surjewala and Jairam Ramesh. KC Venugopal and AK Antony marshal points both for and against and their personal views are not yet known.Sources indicated that the current divide is on allowing Mr Kishor a free hand to start his own set-up and change things within the party. There is also reservation about the execution of his plan -- the concerns are that it might overlap with his other interests vis-a-vis other parties.Mr Kishor has been political advisor to Trinamool Congress chief and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Andhra Pradesh counterpart Jagan Mohan Reddy, the chief of YSR Congress. Both parties are old rivals of the Congress in the states.Mr Kishor\\'s plans for rejuvenation of the party -- at least the two-year-old one that has been leaked to the public -- includes a policy of leadership revamp under which all but mass leaders have been sidelined in terms of giving direction to the party and its day-to-day leadership.This is likely to include most of the leaders currently in the Working Committee, which is the party\\'s highest decision-making body.Those in favour of Mr Kishor\\'s entry, are of the opinion that it would expose the faultlines in the Congress leadership and how a key \"coterie\" operates.Both sides, however, unanimously agree that nothing can be done without the express approval and support of the Congress president.Sources in the committee today said Mrs Gandhi had a separate meeting with Kamal Nath and she is expected to take a decision irrespective of the lack of consensus.Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.
